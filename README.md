# LeetCode DSA Crash Course

This repository contains my solutions and notes for the **LeetCode Interview Crash Course on Data Structures and Algorithms**.

The goal of this repo is track my progress and deepen my understanding of core algorithmic concepts, not just to prepare for interviews — but to build long-term problem-solving skills useful in real-world development.

## 🧠 Contents

- ✅ Official LeetCode Crash Course problems
- 💡 Extra/custom practice problems and examples
- 📝 Clean, readable C++ implementations
- 📂 Structured by topic (arrays, trees, graphs, etc.)

## 🛠 Language

All solutions are written in **C++**, chosen for its:
- Performance and memory control
- Strong alignment with low-level algorithm understanding
- Sharpening problem-solving through stricter syntax and types

## 🧭 Why?

Even in the age of AI, the ability to reason about time, space, and algorithmic trade-offs is still valuable — both for writing efficient code and understanding how systems behave under the hood.
